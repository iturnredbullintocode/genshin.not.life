Sometimes I worry that the applications I code are too portable but
I decided to make this public for now. May private later.

Most genshin database apps lack a human component,
(the notable exception being the genshin map! love you guys) so I'm aiming to fill that space.
Moreover, many genshin guide websites nowadays are AI-generated and I aim to provide
a more human hand in that area as well.


Current Objectives
==================
- issue tracking setup
- UI or UI framework setup
- use my usual PHP framework that I've coded myself for other gaming sites orrr..?
- (Also should I publish the above framework?)
- parsing of achievement data
- add discord server to project (same as my cream one or make new?)

My apologies for using this readme to brainstorm, but I'd like the users to see my thought process today.


General Notes for Readers
=========================
üçë None of the larger app creators are divulging the info on how they parse and decrypt game
files to datamine, I would love to be a part of this process (I bet theres a discord group somewhere),
so please invite me. Right now I'm stuck using
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MadeBaruna/paimon-moe/main/src/data/achievement/en.json
and https://genshin.honeyhunterworld.com/new-in-4-3/?lang=EN#delim_6 for raw data.

üçë This is a frameworkless PHP & vanilla JS app, very minimal libraries, not even using jQuery.
It is part of a 16 year long experiment I've been running with at least 10 apps,
since I do not get to use vanilla code for my job, nor to make my own libraries and frameworks.
I really love to toy around with base concepts of languages
and I don't get to actually do that for large corporations, so this is my corner.
I also code python apps, it has lovely syntax.
PHP was my first web app language and I'm fond of how 2000s-core it is.

üçë I do play genshin, right now I'm building a Pyro Freminet self-melt team with c6 Bennett,
Furina, and Shenhe.
