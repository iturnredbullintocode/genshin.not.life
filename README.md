Sometimes I worry that the applications I code are too portable but
I decided to make this public for now. May private later.

Purpose of this app is to provide an interesting source of news for the NA/EU players of Night Crows,
and to unite them into one community. The website is meant mostly for english speakers,
seeing as the english-speaking community in Night Crows is a minority and we need to rally together.
Other than news, this website will provide a few guides, tools, and calculators.
We may also develop a better version of the current discord bot that people use for guilds.


Current Objectives
==================
- issue tracking setup
- UI or UI framework setup
- use my usual PHP framework that I've coded myself for other gaming sites orrr..?
- (Also should I publish the above framework?)
- parsing of achievement data
- add discord server to project (same as my cream one or make new?)

My apologies for using this readme to brainstorm, but I'd like the users to see my thought process today.


General Notes for Readers
=========================
üçë None of the larger app creators are divulging the info on how they parse and decrypt game
files to datamine, I would love to be a part of this process (I bet theres a discord group somewhere),
so please invite me. Right now I'm stuck using
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MadeBaruna/paimon-moe/main/src/data/achievement/en.json
and https://genshin.honeyhunterworld.com/new-in-4-3/?lang=EN#delim_6 for raw data.

üçë This is a frameworkless PHP & vanilla JS app, very minimal libraries, not even using jQuery.
It is part of a 16 year long experiment I've been running with at least 10 apps,
since I do not get to use vanilla code for my job, nor to make my own libraries and frameworks.
I really love to toy around with base concepts of languages
and I don't get to actually do that for large corporations, so this is my corner.
I also code python apps, it has lovely syntax.
PHP was my first web app language and I'm fond of how 2000s-core it is.

üçë I do play Night Crows, I'm on server Rook 102 and my ign is Creamed.
